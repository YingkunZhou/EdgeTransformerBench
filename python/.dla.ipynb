In case you’re unfamiliar, the DLA is an application specific integrated circuit on Jetson Xavier and Orin that is capable of running common deep learning inference operations, such as convolutions.  This dedicated hardware is power efficient, and allows you to offload work from the GPU, freeing it for other tasks.  If you’re interested in better utilizing the full capabilities of your Jetson platform, this tutorial is for you.\n",

    "To demonstrate how to use the DLA, we’ll run through the entire modeling process; from designing and training an architecture in PyTorch, to calibrating the model for INT8 precision, to profiling and validating the model.  We hope this will give you a better understanding of how to use the DLA, as well as its capabilities and limitations.  Understanding this information early on is important, as it will help you make design decisions to ensure your model can be easily accelerated by the DLA, enabling you to further unlock the capabilities of Jetson Orin.\n",
